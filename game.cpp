#include <iostream>
// library collection of things for std and other things

using namespace std;
// saying this helps so we don't have to write std before every cout

int main()
// the main returns as a int kinda like a result
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
    // cout = console out - this is an object which has the ability to use a string
    // std = standard template - you need this to use cout 
    // endl means to end the line, \n means new line
    
    cout << "you're a beast" << endl;



    return 0;
    // this implies that the main ran just fine
